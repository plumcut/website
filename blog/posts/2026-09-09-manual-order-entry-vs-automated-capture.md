faq:
  - q: What is manual order entry in delivery software?
    a: It is a person reading an order from somewhere else, usually a WhatsApp thread, a phone call or an email, and typing it into the delivery or fleet platform as a new job. The order already exists as a decision between you and the customer. Manual entry is the step that turns it into a row the system can dispatch, and it is pure re-keying, because no new information is created by the typing.
  - q: Is automated order capture more accurate than a person typing?
    a: Not automatically, and the honest answer is that it moves the errors rather than removing them. A person mis-hears a street name; an automated capture accepts an address the customer wrote badly. The real gain is that validation runs on every order instead of on the ones an agent happens to double check, and the rules are written once rather than living in one experienced person's head. An automated capture with no validation layer is worse than a careful agent.
  - q: Do I need to replace my delivery software to automate order entry?
    a: No, in most cases. Established delivery and fleet platforms expose a REST API for creating jobs and webhooks for status changes, which is the same route their own integrations use. If your platform has that, the conversational layer sits in front of it and writes into the system you already run. If it has no API at all, that is a real blocker and worth asking your vendor about before changing anything else.
  - q: When is manual order entry still the right choice?
    a: When volume is low enough that the typing costs less than the integration, when nearly every order is negotiated rather than repeated, or when your platform genuinely has no API. A few orders a day handled by someone who knows the customers does not need automating. The case changes when the same order shape is being retyped dozens of times a day and mistakes start costing you failed deliveries.
  - q: What happens to orders the automation cannot handle?
    a: They should go to a person, with the conversation attached, and that path is not a failure of the design. A good capture flow decides between a complete order it can create, an incomplete one it should ask about, and an unusual one it should hand over. The number worth watching is how often handover happens and why, because that list tells you what to fix next.

Manual order entry vs automated order capture comes down to volume: retyping suits low volume and negotiated orders, while automated capture wins when the same order shape repeats all day.

Someone on your team is reading a WhatsApp message and typing what it says into a delivery dashboard. The order was already agreed in the chat. The typing adds no information, it only moves the order from one system into another, and it is where addresses get mangled, phone numbers lose a digit and the delivery window quietly changes. If your fleet or delivery software is good and your team is still doing this all day, the software is not the problem.

> There are four common ways an order gets from a customer message into a delivery dashboard: an agent retypes it, you send the customer a form or link, the customer places it themselves in a portal, or a conversational layer captures it in the chat and writes it into the platform through its API. They are not ranked. Retyping is the right answer at low volume and for negotiated orders. Portals win for repeat business customers who will log in. Forms are cheap but push work onto a customer who was happy in the chat. Automated capture wins when the same order shape repeats many times a day, and its real advantage is not speed but that validation runs on every single order instead of on the ones a tired agent happens to check twice. The blocker is rarely the conversation. It is whether your delivery platform exposes an API to create a job.

## Disclosure before the comparison

plumcut builds the fourth option in this list, so we have a commercial interest in it. We have tried to write the other three the way their best users would describe them, including the cases where they beat us. If your volume is low, option one is genuinely cheaper than anything we would sell you, and the last section says so plainly.

## The four routes, compared

| | Agent retypes | Form or link sent in chat | Customer self-serve portal | Conversational capture into the API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Who does the typing | Your team | The customer, again | The customer, once, in your system | Nobody types twice |
| Where errors come from | Mis-hearing, mis-reading, fatigue late in the day | Customer fills fields wrong, no one checks | Customer fills fields wrong, but the form can validate | Bad input from the customer, unless the capture validates it |
| Time from message to dispatchable order | Minutes to hours, depending on the queue | Depends entirely on when the customer clicks | Immediate, if they use it | Seconds, if the order is complete |
| Main failure mode | Backlog at peak, and the peak is when it matters | Customers ignore the link and reply in the chat instead | Adoption, most consumer customers will not create an account | Silent creation of a wrong order, if validation is thin |
| Cost shape | Scales with headcount | Low, mostly setup | Usually part of your platform licence | Build or subscription, flat against volume |
| Best fit | Low volume, negotiated or unusual orders | Occasional overflow, one off requests | Repeat business customers with accounts | The same order shape, many times a day |

Read the bottom row first. Most operations are running one of these because of history, not because it fits, and the fix is often to move a slice of orders rather than all of them.

## Why retyping survives longer than it should

It survives because it always works. There is no integration to break, no edge case that cannot be handled, and the person doing it can read intent, spot that a customer means the office address and not the home one, and catch the order that says two boxes but means two hundred.

That flexibility is real, and it is why the honest recommendation at low volume is to leave it alone. The cost is not the minute of typing. It is three things that only appear at scale.

**The peak is when you are worst.** Order entry queues exactly when order volume spikes, which is exactly when a delayed dispatch costs a delivery slot.

**The knowledge lives in one head.** The person who knows that a particular customer always means the back entrance is the reason your error rate looks acceptable. When they leave, the error rate is the truth about your process.

**Nobody measures it.** Retyping is not a line in any system, so no report says what it costs. The failed deliveries it causes are recorded as courier problems.

## Why forms and portals lose to the chat

Both are technically better than retyping and both lose ground for the same reason: they ask the customer to move.

A customer who is already writing to you on WhatsApp has chosen their channel. Sending them a link is asking them to leave a conversation for a form, and a meaningful share will simply reply with the order in the chat anyway, which puts you back at retyping with an extra step. Portals work, genuinely well, with repeat business customers who order weekly and will keep a login. They rarely work with consumers.

This is the whole argument for capturing in the conversation: not that forms are bad, but that the order is already being given to you in words, and the work is turning those words into a row in your system.

## What automated capture actually is

It is four steps, and only the third one touches your delivery platform.

1. **Read the conversation** and pull out the fields an order needs: who, where, what, when, how it is paid.
2. **Validate before creating anything.** Is the address specific enough to dispatch? Is the phone number in a shape a driver can call? Is the requested window one you actually serve? Is the cash on delivery amount stated in the right currency? Missing or ambiguous fields become one clear question in the chat, not a guess.
3. **Create the job through the platform's API**, with your own reference attached so the same order cannot be created twice.
4. **Send the order number back into the conversation**, so the customer has a reference and your team can see the order exists without opening the dashboard.

Step two is the part people underestimate and it is where the accuracy gain lives. A careful agent validates the orders they have energy for. A capture flow validates all of them, the same way, at 2am. That is the difference worth paying for, more than the seconds saved.

## The real prerequisite: does your platform have an API

This is the question to answer before comparing anything else, because it decides whether option four is even available to you. The pattern is standard across established delivery and fleet platforms: a REST endpoint that creates a job, and webhooks that push status changes back to you.

Onfleet, for example, documents a REST API for creating and managing tasks, authenticated with an organization API key, together with webhooks that fire on task events and arrive as HTTP POST requests carrying the trigger that caused them ([Onfleet API reference](https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/tasks), [webhooks reference](https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/webhooks)). Track-POD documents webhook events including create order, update order status and route events, alongside its order import API ([Track-POD API](https://api.track-pod.com/index.html)). Detrack documents a REST API covering job creation and proof of delivery data, with webhooks for job events ([Detrack API](https://detrackapiv2.docs.apiary.io/)). Shipday documents a JSON REST API for orders and drivers with an order status update webhook ([Shipday API](https://docs.shipday.com/reference/shipday-api)). Checked September 2026, and vendor features change, so confirm against your own platform's current documentation and your plan.

If your platform is in that group, the integration is ordinary work. If it is a spreadsheet, a shared login or an internal tool with no API, that is the thing to fix first, and it is a fair question to put to your vendor.

## How to choose, in one pass

Answer these four in order and stop at the first no.

1. **Are you retyping the same shape of order more than about twenty times a day?** If no, keep retyping and spend the money elsewhere.
2. **Does the order arrive as a conversation rather than through a checkout?** If it arrives through a checkout, you have a store integration problem, not a conversation one, and [what to automate first](/blog/what-to-automate-first-ecommerce) is the more useful read.
3. **Does your delivery platform expose an order creation API?** If no, this is the blocker to solve.
4. **Can you write down the validation rules a good agent applies?** If you cannot, write them down first. Automating a rule nobody has stated is how you create wrong orders quickly.

## Where plumcut fits

plum sits on the conversation side. It handles the customer thread on WhatsApp, captures the order out of it in the customer's own words, including Lebanese and Gulf Arabizi written in Latin script, asks for the one field that is missing rather than a full form, and writes the finished order into the delivery or fleet platform you already use through that platform's API. The dashboard stays yours. The typing stops.

Two ways that gets bought. An operator connects plum to the platform they run. Or the logistics software vendor adds it as a feature for their own clients, which is the arrangement we look at in [connecting WhatsApp orders to fleet software](/blog/connect-whatsapp-orders-fleet-software). Either way, see [how it works](/how-it-works) for the mechanics and [pricing](/pricing) for what running it costs.

## What to do this week

Count it before you change it. For three days, log every order that gets typed into your dashboard by hand: how many, at what hours, and how many later needed a correction or caused a failed delivery. That log answers question one above honestly, and it is the same evidence you will need to justify the integration internally. If the count is small, you have just saved yourself a project. If it is not, you now know exactly which hours of the day the automation has to be right.
