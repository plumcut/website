ctaLine: Your customer's request ends inside your systems, not in the chat. Ask plum what it would take to have the order, the record and the internal handover happen on their own.
faq:
  - q: Is AI customer service the same thing as operations automation?
    a: No. Customer service automation produces a reply. Operations automation produces a change in a system: an order created, a record updated, a courier booked, an internal task raised. Most requests need both, and a business that automates only the reply still pays a person to do the second half by hand. The reply is also the part that is commoditising fastest, because Meta now ships a business agent that answers on a brand's own WhatsApp number.
  - q: What does it actually mean for an AI agent to take an action?
    a: It means the agent calls another system and changes something there, rather than only reading from it. Looking up an order status is a read. Creating the order, changing a delivery address, raising a return or writing a qualified lead into a CRM is a write. Writes need credentials with permission to change data, validation of what goes in, a confirmation step with the customer, a record of what changed, and a written list of things the agent may never do on its own.
  - q: Why is the internal half of a customer request harder in MENA than in Europe or the US?
    a: Mostly because the data the internal step needs is shaped differently. Saudi Arabia uses a national short address issued by Saudi Post, four letters followed by four digits, for last mile delivery. Dubai uses Makani, a ten digit code from Dubai Municipality that identifies a building entrance. Lebanon has no unified national addressing at all and couriers navigate by landmark. A capture step that asks for a street line and a postal code produces a failed delivery in all three. Add cash on delivery confirmation where it is still used, and Arabizi input that has to become structured data, and the internal half carries work a global template does not account for.
  - q: Should an AI agent be allowed to write to my store or CRM?
    a: Yes, for the narrow set of writes you have defined, with a confirmation step and a log. The safe pattern is a short list of permitted actions, each with validated inputs, rather than broad access to the API. Keep decisions that cost real money, such as refunds above a threshold, discounts beyond policy, and anything touching a disputed order, behind a human approval that the agent prepares but does not grant.
  - q: Is Meta's business agent enough on its own?
    a: It is enough to answer. Meta said in June 2026 that more than a million businesses were already using a Business Agent on WhatsApp and Messenger, and it is free to activate, but since 1 August 2026 its replies are billed at 2 US dollars per million tokens, about 4 to 5 cents per message. Its developer documentation describes custom connectors to external APIs so an agent can check an order or book an appointment. Someone still has to build those connectors against your systems, decide what the agent may change, and keep it working when your API changes. Eligibility is also restricted by vertical and country, and one phone number cannot run two competing messaging products at once.
  - q: What should stay with a person when the rest is automated?
    a: The decisions, not the typing. Approving money out, accepting an order from a delivery area that has lost you money, releasing a refund on a disputed item, and any exception that has never happened before. Automate the holding, the notification, the preparation of everything needed to decide, and the record of what was decided. Never automate the yes itself.

AI can automate far beyond customer service, and the value is in the internal work after the reply: creating the order in the store, writing the CRM record, booking the courier and sending the exception to the one person who can approve it.

A customer in Riyadh asks to change the delivery address on an order that ships tomorrow. The agent replies in four seconds, in her own language, politely, correctly. Nothing has happened. The address in the store is unchanged, the courier still holds the old label, and the person who packs at seven in the morning has not been told. The conversation looks finished. The work has not started.

> Automating customer service is the visible half, and it is quickly becoming the cheap half. Meta now ships a business agent that answers on your own WhatsApp number, and said in June 2026 that more than a million businesses were already using one across WhatsApp and Messenger. What is not a commodity is the internal half: the order created in the store, the record written to the CRM, the courier booked with an address the courier will accept, the exception routed to the one person who can approve it, and the confirmation sent back once the thing is genuinely done. A request is not resolved when the reply is sent. It is resolved when something changed in a system. In MENA that second half carries more work than the English language demos suggest, because the address is a national short code or a Makani number rather than a street line, because cash on delivery still needs confirming in some markets, and because the message that starts all of it often arrives in Arabizi.

## Answering is turning into the cheap part

Meta [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/06/meta-business-agent/) in June 2026 that it was expanding Meta Business Agent to businesses of all sizes globally, that more than a million businesses were already using one on WhatsApp and Messenger, and that businesses could activate it for free. Its replies are not free: [since 1 August 2026](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/pricing/non-template-messages) Meta bills them at 2 US dollars per million tokens, which [its pricing page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing) puts at about 4 to 5 cents per message. Its developer [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/meta-business-agent/overview) describes an agent that answers from knowledge you provide and takes actions through custom connectors to your external APIs, such as checking an order or booking an appointment.

Read that as a market signal rather than a product review. When the platform itself gives away a competent answering layer, "we reply instantly" stops being a reason anyone chooses you. Your competitor will soon reply instantly too, at no cost, on the same channel.

What does not arrive free is permission and plumbing: what your automation is allowed to change inside your business, and the connectors that let it. Meta's own [getting started page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/meta-business-agent/get-started) makes the shape of that clear. The number has to be on the Cloud API, the business has to sit in an eligible country and an eligible vertical, with finance, government, health, alcohol, gambling, over the counter drugs and matrimony excluded, and a single number cannot run two competing messaging products at once. Those are exactly the questions of ownership and wiring that a cheap answering layer does not resolve for you.

## A request is only finished when something changes in a system

Take the six messages a commerce team actually receives and split each one down the middle.

| What the customer asks | The visible half | The internal half | Who normally does the internal half |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Where is my order? | A status and a date | Nothing. It is a lookup | Already automated in most tools |
| Do you deliver to my area? | Yes, no, and the fee | Nothing. It is a lookup | Already automated in most tools |
| I want two of these | Price, stock, delivery time | Create the order, reserve the stock, take payment or confirm cash on delivery, raise the packing task | A person, retyping |
| Change my delivery address | A confirmation | Update the order, reissue the courier label, recheck the zone and the fee, tell whoever packs | A person, retyping |
| I want to return this | The policy | Create the return, notify the warehouse, hold the refund for approval | A person, retyping |
| We buy wholesale, who do I talk to? | A useful reply | Create the account record, assign an owner, schedule the follow up | A person, or nobody |

The first two rows are the ones every chatbot demo shows, because they are reads. The other four are writes, and writes are where your staff hours actually go.

## Read versus write is the line that matters

A read is safe. It cannot break anything, it is easy to demonstrate, and if it returns the wrong thing the customer simply asks again. That is why almost every vendor can show you one.

A write changes state. It needs credentials with permission to change data rather than view it, validation of what goes in, a confirmation step with the customer before it commits, a record of what changed and why, and a clear boundary around what the agent may never touch. That is real engineering, and it is the reason the demo tends to stop at order tracking.

When you evaluate anything, evaluate the writes. Everything else is table stakes by now, and we compare the main tools on exactly that axis in [which WhatsApp AI actually does the work](/blog/whatsapp-ai-that-takes-action-mena).

## In MENA the internal half carries more work

This is where a global template quietly fails, because the fields the internal step has to fill are not the fields the template expects.

**The address is not a street line.** Saudi Arabia runs a [national address](https://splonline.com.sa/en/national-address-1/) issued by Saudi Post, with a short address of four letters followed by four digits that identifies a specific building entrance and is used for last mile delivery. Dubai uses [Makani](https://www.makani.ae/), a ten digit code introduced by Dubai Municipality that pins an entrance rather than a building footprint. Lebanon has no unified national addressing at all, so couriers work from district, building and a landmark, plus a phone number that actually answers. One capture step asking for "street address, city, postal code" produces a failed delivery in all three markets.

So the write is not just a write. It is a write with a country specific shape, validated at capture, while the customer is still in the conversation and can correct it. Getting that wrong costs a redelivery, a phone call and a refund request, which is a far more expensive mistake than a slow reply.

**Payment state has to be resolved before fulfilment.** Cash on delivery has been falling fast. Checkout.com's MENA research [reported](https://www.checkout.com/newsroom/checkout-coms-4th-annual-mena-report-finds-cash-on-delivery-usage-halved-amongst-maturing-digital-economy) that regional preference for cash on delivery halved from 41 percent to 20 percent over 48 months, and fell to as low as 10 percent in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait. Check the current figure for your own market before you plan around it, because this one is moving every year. Either way it is internal work: a prepaid order needs a payment link, a confirmation and a reconciled record, and a cash order needs a confirmation step before anyone packs it.

**The message arrives in Arabizi.** A real inbound line looks more like "baddi ghayyir l address la Jounieh, l order jeye bokra" than anything in a vendor's sample data. Understanding it is one problem, covered in our guide to [Arabic customer service](/blog/ai-customer-service-arabic). Turning it into a validated address change in the right system is the second, and it is the one nobody demos.

**And it all starts on WhatsApp.** DataReportal's [Digital 2026 Saudi Arabia](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2026-saudi-arabia) report puts WhatsApp use at 92.2 percent of internet users in the country, the highest of any platform it lists. The channel your operations have to reach into is the one your customer already lives in.

## The three internal jobs worth wiring first

**Capture.** The conversation becomes a record with validated fields: an order, a lead, a return. No retyping, no screenshots, no "I will add it later". This is the single highest frequency retype in a commerce business and the one where a dropped digit costs a real delivery.

**Reach.** The right internal person is told once, in the place they already look, with everything needed to act attached. Not a group chat where it scrolls away. The test is whether the person can act without opening a second system.

**Close the loop.** When the internal thing is done, the customer hears it without anyone remembering to tell them. Most teams manage capture and reach, then leave the customer to chase. That final message is the cheapest trust you will ever buy, and it removes the follow up question that would otherwise land on a human.

## Ten minutes that will tell you more than a demo

Ask any vendor, including us, these five questions in this order.

1. **Show the agent creating a record in my system, not reading one.** Use your own store or CRM, not their sandbox.
2. **What happens when the write fails?** The honest answer involves a retry, a visible failure, and a human being told. The bad answer is silence.
3. **Who writes the action, and who fixes it when my API changes?** If the answer is "you do", price your own hours into the comparison.
4. **What can the agent never do without a person?** A vendor with no answer has not thought about it.
5. **Show me a log of everything it changed yesterday.** If nothing can produce that list, you do not have operations automation, you have a chatbot with credentials.

## What should stay with a person

Automate the retype, never the decision. Keep a short list behind a human: refunds above a threshold, discounts beyond policy, orders to delivery areas that have lost you money, first orders from new wholesale accounts, and anything that has never happened before. Automate the holding, the notification and the record of what was decided, so the person spends seconds on it instead of an afternoon. Never automate the yes itself.

## Where plumcut fits

The line at the top of our home page is "beyond the reply", and this is what it means. [plumcut](/solutions) is ours, so weigh it accordingly.

plum handles the conversation on your own WhatsApp number in Arabic, Arabizi and English, sells rather than only replying, and we connect it to the systems the business already runs on, including Shopify, WooCommerce, Stripe, PayPal, Google Calendar, Calendly, HubSpot, Salesforce, Gmail and Slack, so an order agreed in a chat becomes an order in the store, a payment that is actually collected, a task for whoever packs it and a record in your CRM without a person retyping anything. We build the wiring and we keep it working. You do not touch a builder, and when your API changes it is our problem, not your evening. See [how it works](/how-it-works) or [pricing](/pricing).

The honest limit: if you have someone in house who owns this work and enjoys it, a self serve platform will cost you less money and you should buy one. We are the right answer when the work spans the conversation and the systems behind it, when it happens in two or three languages, and when nobody on your team is going to own it.

## What to do this week

1. Take the last twenty conversations and mark each one read or write. The write column is your project.
2. For the top write, list the exact fields the internal system needs, including the address format for each country you ship to.
3. Decide the five actions your automation may perform, and write down what it may never do.
4. Pick the one internal person each action must reach, and the place they already look.
5. Add the loop back to the customer, and measure how many follow up messages disappear.

Answering is table stakes now. The work after the reply is the part still worth paying for.
